## 🌐 Overview

Every founder operates differently — some thrive in systems, others in people or vision.  
FounderDNA analyzes how you think, build, and execute by evaluating your tendencies across **four primary axes**:

- **Visionary** — Ideation, creativity, innovation, and future orientation.  
- **Grounded** — Stability, consistency, reliability, and execution focus.  
- **Systems** — Process, structure, optimization, and scalability.  
- **People** — Collaboration, influence, empathy, and leadership.

Your result combines your top **two dominant dimensions**, producing one of **eight FounderDNA archetypes**.
